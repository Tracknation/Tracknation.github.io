	<h2>Ghost 7</h2>
	<p>The Ghost 7 is a triple threat of balance, cushion, and lightweight materials. Hitting the 
	sweet spot for millions of runners, this neutral running shoe for men gives you the stuff to kick
	back for miles on end, or lean in and pick up the pace. We’ve maintained the horseshoe-shaped 
	crash pad, full ground contact, and omega grooves in the forefoot for the super-smooth heel-to-toe
	transition runners love. We’ve improved the multi-award-winning Ghost by making it smoother and 
	lighter. BioMoGo DNA in the midsole offers adaptive cushioning while staying more flexible. 
	Bigger lugs in the forefoot make the Ghost feel more responsive as you run. And the look? 
	More modern while remaining technical, thanks to the Ghost’s signature color-shift chevron 
	and no-sew overlays. The Ghost may scare off the competition, but it’s plenty friendly to your 
	feet.</p>

	<p>Every lace and stitch of the all-new Glycerin 12 running shoe goes above and beyond the 
	standards of comfort. This neutral running shoe for men was inspired by the clouds and designed
	to feel like running in a meadow toward the one you love. New Super DNA provides 20% more 
	cushioning than BioMoGo DNA, while Ideal Pressure Zones in the outsole optimize pressure 
	distribution from heel to forefoot. And the upper? A conformable saddle wraps the foot, 
	while 3D Fit Print creates a custom fit without adding weight. At just 9.1 ounces, the
	Glycerin 12 is lighter than ever, but full of new technologies to elevate your run.
